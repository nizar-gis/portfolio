Nizar — GIS Portfolio
Geospatial Analyst | Cartographer | Web GIS Developer | Asset Management Specialist

15+ years of experience delivering spatial analysis, cartographic design, asset management solutions, and web GIS applications for local government, utilities, environmental programs, and public safety initiatives. Passionate about transforming geographic information into meaningful insights that support real-world decision-making.

✨ About Me

I am a GIS professional with a unique blend of experience across transportation, stormwater, wastewater, environmental programs, and public safety analytics. I specialize in building spatial solutions—from dashboards and StoryMaps to site-selection models and automated QA/QC tools—using ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Enterprise, Python, SQL, and web mapping applications.

My work spans:

Advanced spatial analytics (Moran’s I, Gi*, KDE, space-time cubes)

ArcGIS Business Analyst market and demographics modeling

Web GIS development (Experience Builder, Dashboards, Web Maps)

Asset management integrations (Cityworks, Maximo, CMMS)

Data modeling, schema design, and QA/QC automation

Public infrastructure mapping (TNET, wastewater, stormwater)

Cartographic design for visually compelling map-based storytelling

I believe maps change how people understand problems—and how they choose solutions.
