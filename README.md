About Me

I am a GIS professional with a unique blend of experience across transportation, stormwater, wastewater, environmental programs, and public safety analytics. I specialize in building spatial solutions from dashboards and StoryMaps to site-selection models and automated QA/QC tools—using ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Enterprise, Python, SQL, and web mapping applications.

My work spans:

Advanced spatial analytics (Moran’s I, Gi*, KDE, space-time cubes)

ArcGIS Business Analyst market and demographics modeling

Web GIS development (Experience Builder, Dashboards, Web Maps)

Asset management integrations (Cityworks, GraniteNet, CMMS)

Data modeling, schema design, and QA/QC automation

Public infrastructure mapping (TNET, wastewater, stormwater)

Cartographic design for visually compelling map-based storytelling

I believe maps change how people understand problems—and how they choose solutions.
